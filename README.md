# Theseusfit
Theseusfit applies GPU-accelerated second-order nonlinear optimization for rapid fitting of multidimensional imaging datasets. These capabilities are built in PyTorch, using [Theseus](https://github.com/facebookresearch/theseus/tree/main) to provide a Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer for efficient and stable convergence. This library is designed around the processing of high-dimensional imaging datasets, such as hyperspectral microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging, or X-ray fluorescence microscopy, which frequently call for time-intensive pixel-by-pixel fitting approaches. Rather than iteratively treating each pixel as an independent optimization problem, Theseusfit works simultaneously across large batches of pixels to take advantage of parallel processing on a GPU. While the method is generalizable across many parallel fitting problems, the demonstration here is specific to the challenge of fitting absolute-intensity hyperspectral photoluminescence data to the Generalized Planck equation. The result is the dramatic acceleration of fitting to extract key optoelectronic performance parameters such as the quasi-Fermi level splitting and the Urbach energy.
